# PRODIGY_SD_01

Create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. The program should prompt the user to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement. It should then convert the temperature to the other two units and display the converted values to the user. For example, if the user enters a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, the program should convert it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin, and present the converted values as outputs.

Explanation:
Function Prototypes: The program declares prototypes for the conversion functions.
Main Function:
Prompts the user for a temperature value and the unit of measurement.
Uses a switch statement to determine the unit of measurement and calls the appropriate conversion function.
Conversion Functions:
convertFromCelsius: Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin.
convertFromFahrenheit: Converts Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin.
convertFromKelvin: Converts Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit.
